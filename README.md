They change the look and feel of the device's user interface, including the home screen, app drawer, settings menu, and other elements. Skins are used in Android to differentiate the device from others, and to offer a unique user experience.

1. _Customizing the Look and Feel_: Skins allow manufacturers to change the look and feel of the device's user interface, including the icons, colors, fonts, and other elements. This allows for a unique and personalized experience for the user.

2. _Adding Additional Features_: Skins often include additional features and functionality not found in stock Android, such as a custom app drawer, integrated weather and news updates, and a redesigned settings menu.

3. _Enhancing the User Experience_: Skins can enhance the user experience by making the device more user-friendly, such as by adding a control center for quick access to frequently used settings, or a magazine lock screen with news and weather updates.

4. _Brand Differentiation_: Skins allow manufacturers to differentiate their devices from others, and to promote their brand. Each skin provides a unique look and feel, which can be a selling point for the device.

1. Age: TouchWiz has been around for many years, while OneUI was introduced in 2019.

2. Design Philosophy: TouchWiz was criticized for being too cluttered and over-the-top, while OneUI was designed with a more minimalistic approach, with a focus on one-handed use.

3. Features: Both TouchWiz and OneUI include a custom app drawer, integrated weather and news updates, and a redesigned settings menu. However, OneUI includes additional features such as a system-wide dark mode, improved notification management, and an updated camera app.

4. Compatibility: OneUI is only available on Samsung devices running Android 9.0 Pie or later, while TouchWiz was available on devices running older versions of Android.

In summary, OneUI is the latest and more refined version of Samsung's custom skin, offering a more streamlined user experience and a greater focus on usability, compared to the older TouchWiz skin.

To use a Galaxy Emulator Skin, follow the [Samsung developer guide](https://developer.samsung.com/galaxy-emulator-skin/guide.html).

The guide recommends downloading and extracting the Emulator Skin, and moving it to file location *Android Studio > plugins > android > lib > device-art-resources* on a Windows machine. On a Mac, I use the following location *User > username > Library > Android > SDK > skins*.
